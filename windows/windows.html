    <h1>Places I've Lived, Through Windows</h1>

  <div class="all_container">
    <div class="imagecontainer image1">
      <img src="Windows/IMG_0181.JPG" alt="Window showing Charter Oak Apartments parking lot">
      <p>This is my current living room view from my apartment in Charter Oak. It's nice to be able to see my car but the view isn't the most pretty.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image2">
      <img src="Windows/IMG_0182.JPG" alt="Window showing outside of apartment building">
      <p>This is the view from my current bedroom. I think those are air conditioning units but I'm not entirely sure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image3">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.50.41 PM.png" alt="Window showing outside of dormitory building">
      <p>This is the view from my freshman year dorm's lounge. I had a lot of great memories in that lounge and this photo brings them all back to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image4">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.52.41 PM.png" alt="Cityscape of London">
      <p>This is the view from my room when I studied abroad in London. I loved seeing the cityscape and watching how the sunsets looked on the buildings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image5">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.53.06 PM.png" alt="Window showing lounge chair next to window. Chair has a bong on the armrest.">
      <p>This is the current view from my room back home. It is my favorite place to chill and relax as you can probably tell. It may look familiar from my Project 1 Illustration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image6">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.55.41 PM.png" alt="Dog on bed in front of window showing view of yard">
      <p>This was my dog Mickey back in early 2020 before he passed. He loved laying in front of the window on my dad's bed and bathing in the sun.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image7">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.56.50 PM.png" alt="Desk in front of window showing outside street">
      <p>This is the old view from my room back home, before I moved all the furniture around. It was a perfect desk view because it allowed me to see my mom's car arriving home so I knew when to rush to do the dishes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecontainer image8">
      <img src="Windows/Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.57.30 PM.png" alt="3rd story window showing man walking dogs on grass outside">
      <p>This is the only photo I have of the view from my first apartment. People would often play frisbee on the grass or have picnics.</p>
