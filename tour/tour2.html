    <ol>
        <li>Hanging light - Hit my head on this way too many times.</li>
        <li>Dining room table - This is where we set up the menorahs to celebrate Hanukkah. A lot of childhood memories here.</li>
        <li>Broken radio - Hasn't been used in at least 10 years, not sure why we still keep it there</li>
        <li>Bookcase - Has family photos sitting on top, the only time I can see what my great grandparents looked like.</li>
        <li>Weird storage thing I don't know the name of - We have a lot of random things in here like a chess board and playing cards.</li>
        <li>Shelves that hold a lot of antique plates and other things from my great grandparents.</li>
    </ol>
