    <p>The place I am choosing to do this project on is my house. My house has a lot of character and has different vibes depending on which room you’re in. When arriving to my house, it looks pretty cookie-cutter like the rest of the houses in the area. However the first quirk is the front lawn which has really patchy grass from years of having dogs tear up the yard. Our lawn is pretty ugly but it’s worth it because our dogs get to have a lot of fun there. When entering the house, there is normally a scent of something cooking since my mom loves to try new recipes all the time. Before you get a chance to step in the door though, you will be trampled by two overly friendly dogs. The main floor of the house is pretty cozy, there is a lot of hand-me-down furniture from my great grandparents which gives the rooms character and a warm feeling. Our living room is kind of a mess because I moved all my weightlifting equipment over there once COVID hit. The upstairs is notoriously cold in the winter and hot in the summer. These days I always have to wear a hoodie and slippers otherwise I would freeze to death. The basement is like something out of “Hoarders” because my parents refuse to ever throw anything away. There are boxes and boxes of old papers, as well as a myriad of other things that take up space.</p>
