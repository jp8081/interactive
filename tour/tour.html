        <li>Our couch - Has a permanent red protective cover on because the dogs love to use it as home base when chasing each other.</li>
        <li>Fireplace - never been used in the 16 years we have lived here.</li>
        <li>Ottoman - My dad's go-to place to watch camping videos and eat crackers. Sometimes tennis balls roll under the foot rest and our dogs try to stick their heads underneath to grab them.</li>
        <li>Fold up fence - We put this across the living room entrance so the dogs don't escape when we have guests over. Josie learned that she can simply jump over it but Katie still hasn't realized.</li>
        <li>Window looking out to the driveway - when you pull in, you'll always see a dog looking back at you from that window.</li>
        <li>Rug - Firmly believe that a living room is not a living room without this type of rug.</li>
        <li>TV stand - Has all of our old home videos and VHS movies.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Hanging light - Hit my head on this way too many times.</li>
        <li>Dining room table - This is where we set up the menorahs to celebrate Hanukkah. A lot of childhood memories here.</li>
        <li>Broken radio - Hasn't been used in at least 10 years, not sure why we still keep it there</li>
        <li>Bookcase - Has family photos sitting on top, the only time I can see what my great grandparents looked like.</li>
        <li>Weird storage thing I don't know the name of - We have a lot of random things in here like a chess board and playing cards.</li>
        <li>Shelves that hold a lot of antique plates and other things from my great grandparents.</li>
    </ol>
