      This reading offers an important question for us to consider as artists in the digital age. Is our art defined by the digital context in which we make it, or rather is the computer just a medium?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that it depends on the individual person, and that there is no right or wrong answer. Throughout history there have been pioneers who took advantage of their surroundings and turned it into their art form. Some people enjoy making art that is inherently about the means that create it, like creative coding.

      Others may prefer to use digital tools simply as a medium. These are people who would have created the same type of work with or without a digital tool, the tool likely just expedites the process.

    <p>
      Personally, I view technology as a tool for my work because I do not feel tied down to the computer. If computers were to become obsolete, my work would still remain the same so therefore I think that my work just uses technology as a medium.
