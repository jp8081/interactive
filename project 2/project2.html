    <p>I chose this book because it gets at a few ideas that have been circulating in my mind and it also relates to my senior project. The book argues that in a just society, citizens are given ample free time. It argues that it doesn’t make sense to have the right of pursuit of happiness if people aren’t given the free time to take advantage of it. I agree with the claims made in this book completely. I find it ridiculous that citizens have to work 8 hours per day. Combine that with the time it takes for the necessities of life like cooking, cleaning, commuting (which is never paid), paying bills, etc., and you are left with a laughable amount of free time. Our country is overworked and underpaid and I firmly believe it to be a major cause of hopelessness and depression in society. My senior project is based on exploring the importance of leisure via hobbies, and how they provide purpose to a life consumed by labor. I am interested in reading more from this book to see other examples of how leisure is an essential part of the human condition and use it as a resource to gather research from.</p>
